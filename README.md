# Drug Simulator
## rpg game where you play as a drug dealer

This is a project im working on comparing my main three programming languages to see what would be best for the same type of game,
im coding them all exactly the same, this is mostly for learning purposes

### Planned features:

- [ ] Locations
- [ ] Shop to buy guns, pets, ect.
- [ ] splitting the files up into smaller files *this will come at the very end, for now ill keep everything in one file*
- [ ] ...

### Stats:
*lines in total / code in total
##### Longest file: C++ (51 lines)(41 lines)

##### (imo)Prettiest file: C (50 lines)(34 lines)

##### Shortest file: Py  (46 lines)(35 lines)

So far as you can see, C is kind of in the middle of PY and C++. PY and C++ utilize their OOP features, which dosent make C worse then them at all, just wanted to clearify.


I may add another language in the future, just dont know what.
