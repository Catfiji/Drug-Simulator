# Drug Simulator

This is a project im working on comparing my main three programming languages to see what would be best for the same type of game,
im coding them all exactly the same

### Stats:
*lines in total / code in total
##### Longest file: C++ (51 lines)(41 lines)

##### (imo)Prettiest file: C (50 lines)(34 lines)

##### Shortest file: Py  (46 lines)(35 lines)

So far as you can see, C is kind of in the middle of PY and C++. PY and C++ utilize their OOP features, which dosent make C worse then them at all, just wanted to clearify.
